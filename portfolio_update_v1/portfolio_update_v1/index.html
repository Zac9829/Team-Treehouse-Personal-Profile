        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Hi, my full name is Zachary, but you can call me Zac.</p>
        <p>I live on small farm in Sandyville, West Virginia and enjoy it here</p>
        <p>Most of my family is from West Virginia, but I have some in Florida</p>
        <p>I most recently discovered web development and I am enjoying it thus far.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I have many goals in life right now.</p>
        <p>My future goals are to one day learn and achieve the status of a full-stack developer.</p>
        <p>My goal for now  are to learn of the skills listed below.</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>I chose to enter the field of coding because when I was younger always had an interest in computers.</p>
        <p>I have switched my major a few times through college and wasn't sure what would be right for me, but decided to give web development a try.</p>
        <p>Another reason is I have little experience in this field except from what I learned in school 10 years ago and would like to refresh myself and try to make a career of it.</p>
